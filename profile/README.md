## What is Amadeus?  

Amadeus is a comprehensive audio editing software for macOS, designed for users who demand precision and high-quality sound production. It combines a clean, intuitive interface with powerful editing tools, making it suitable for beginners and professionals alike.  

Unlike basic audio applications, Amadeus provides advanced capabilities such as multi-track editing, real-time effects processing, and batch processing of audio files. This allows you to work on complex audio projects with speed and accuracy, whether you are producing music, editing podcasts, or restoring old recordings.  

The software supports a wide range of audio formats, giving you flexibility when importing and exporting files. With its precise editing tools, you can cut, merge, and enhance audio tracks with full control over every detail.  

Amadeus also features non-destructive editing, ensuring that your original recordings remain untouched while you experiment with effects and adjustments. From noise reduction to equalization, the built-in tools make it easy to clean up recordings and achieve professional-grade sound quality.  

Performance is a key focus of Amadeus. Optimized for both Intel-based and Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3), the application runs smoothly even when handling large, high-resolution audio files. Its efficient design ensures that you can work without interruptions or lag.
